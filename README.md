### :rocket: Getting Started
#### Compilation
The prerequisite for contextually affinitive neighborhood retrieval:
```shell
cd extension
sh make.sh
```
#### Run
To begin clustering, simply run:
```shell
sh run.sh
```
where you can modify the config file (i.e. `cifar10_r18_connr`) or the number of devices in `run.sh`
