### :rocket: Getting Started
#### Compilation
The prerequisite for contextually affinitive neighborhood retrieval:
```shell
cd extension
sh make.sh
```
#### Run
- To begin clustering, simply run:
```shell
sh run.sh
```
where you can modify the config file (i.e. `cifar10_r18_connr`) or the number of devices ( i.e. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3`) in `run.sh`.
- For more customized uses, you can directly modify the config file in `configs/`.

- To skip the warm-up training and simply conduct ConNR clustering, we provide the warm-up trained checkpoints in \[[Goolge Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tUldbUs_B5Kzbjor3jhp5AQYLf8enBh7?usp=sharing)\]. Then
1) save the warm-up checkpoints into the folder `ckpt/your_run_name/save_models/`

2) modify the corresponding variables `resume_name` and `resume_epoch`in config file:
  
3) resume training by calling `sh run.sh`. The final checkpoints by ConNR clustering is saved in \[[Goolge Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tUldbUs_B5Kzbjor3jhp5AQYLf8enBh7?usp=sharing)\]
